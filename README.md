# Data Structures â€“ Python  
This repository contains Python implementations of advanced data structures, developed as part of the Data Structures course at Tel Aviv University. The focus is on correctness, efficiency, and applying theoretical concepts in practice.

## Projects  
- **AVL Trees:** Implemented a complete AVL Tree with insert, delete, search, and balancing rotations. Applied complexity analysis and tested with large datasets.  
- **Fibonacci Heap:** Implemented a Fibonacci Heap with efficient operations (insert, extract-min, decrease-key). Applied for priority queue optimization in algorithms.
